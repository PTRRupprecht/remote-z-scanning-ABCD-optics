# ABCD optics for beam propagation for remote z-scanning using Mathematica

This is a selection of code snippets in a Mathematica notebook for evaluating the linear optics propagation in a remote z-scanning scheme as described in the accompanying publication (link/DOI to be added here).

A derivation of the underlying formulae and more context can be found in the pdf in this repository.

The software Mathematica can be used free of charge for a trial period of 15 days and is optimally designed for symbolic calculations.
