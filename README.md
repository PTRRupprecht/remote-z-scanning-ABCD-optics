# ABCD optics for beam propagation for remote z-scanning using Mathematica

This is a selection of code snippets in a Mathematica notebook for evaluating the linear optics propagation in a remote z-scanning scheme as described in the accompanying publication (http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/BOE.7.001656). For a blog post covering the idea of the paper, see https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/fast-z-scanning-using-a-voice-coil-motor/.

A derivation of the underlying formulae and more context can be found in the pdf in this repository.

The software Mathematica can be used free of charge for a trial period of 15 days and is optimally designed for symbolic calculations.
